# Android GPU load: measurements, compact targets, ADPF, display rate — 2026-11-06

Branch `perf/android-gpu-load-20261106` (base `integration/v1.1.0-steprant-all`
at `077ac142`), merged with the audio and SGSR1 test branches into
`integration/v1.6-candidate-20261106`.

## What the 2026-11-04 traces say

| Xiaomi 14, 1.5 build | value |
|---|---|
| Renderer GPU time per frame, 30 FPS, internal 1080 | 21–26 ms (62–79% busy) |
| Same, 60 FPS attempts | 15–18 ms per frame, 92–98% busy |
| Frames slower than 43 ms (33 min session) | 624, median 68.8 ms (one missed vsync) |
| GPU time of those frames | median 50 ms, p90 74 ms; median 1084 draws |
| Slow frames with inline pipeline creation / blocked present | 2 / 0 |
| Android thermal status | 0 throughout |

30 FPS drops are GPU-bound heavy scenes, not CPU, shader compilation or
thermal throttling. Menus with ~120 draws still cost ~25 ms: the load is
per-pixel and fixed per-frame work, not geometry.

Source inspection: every colour render target was RGBA16F (8 bytes/pixel),
including the console's 8-bit and 10-bit fixed-point formats; depth is
D32_S8. Shadow resolution 2x allocates 2560x1440 shadow maps (console:
1280x720). Internal "1080" on the 2670x1200 panel renders 2403x1080
(+25% over 1920x1080). BC textures are native; render targets keep UBWC
(no storage/mutable flags).

## Changes

1. **Pass profile (diagnostics).** plume brackets every Vulkan render pass
   with timestamps outside the pass and counts draws, barriers, copies,
   dispatches and the bytes its load/store ops move. While the Tester records
   with Advanced/Intensive (or `LO_PASS_PROFILE=1`) the log gets a
   `gpu passes:` line every 10 s: per-frame passes, empty passes, pass and
   outside-pass GPU ms, load/store MB, the eight costliest targets, and
   `format_draws_per_frame` (guest draws per Xenos colour format). Lists are
   read when next begun, after their fence: no GPU wait.
2. **Compact render targets** (Tester → *Compact render targets*, saved as
   `compact_render_targets`, `LO_COMPACT_RT=0/1`; restart). With the HDR
   scene off, Xenos 8_8_8_8(_GAMMA) targets become RGBA8 and fixed
   2_10_10_10 become A2B10G10R10: the bits the console stores (the epilogue
   already clamps both classes to [0, 1]), half the bytes per pixel. 7e3,
   16-bit and 32-bit classes and depth are unchanged. Resolves from a compact
   8888 target to an 8888 texture become plain copies. First run with the
   option compiles the new pipeline variants on demand.
3. **ADPF power hints** (Tester → *Power hints (ADPF)*, `performance_hints`,
   `LO_ADPF=0/1`, `LO_ADPF_TARGET_PERCENT`; live). One APerformanceHint
   session for the guest main and render threads reports the busier thread's
   CPU time per frame against 50% of the frame period, with prefer power
   efficiency on API 35+. A `performance hints:` log line every 10 s.
4. **Match display refresh** (Tester, `display_rate_hint`, default on; live).
   `Surface.setFrameRate(fps, FIXED_SOURCE)` on the phone surface for the
   native target, so a 120 Hz panel can run 60/30 Hz. TV output keeps its
   60 Hz request.
5. **900p render resolution**: 1600x900 at 16:9, 2003x900 on the phone panel.
6. **SGSR1 kept on swapchain format change** (it fell back to the ordinary
   filter until restart).

All options except (4) and (6) are off by default until measured.

## Verification performed

- Lavapipe: profiled presentation pass (timestamps, byte counts, draw count);
  7/7 presentation readbacks; SGSR1 reference comparison (other branch).
- Host: pass-profile summary, ADPF policy, render resolution (14,055 checks),
  settings menu suite including every new Tester row, config round-trip.
- Production `renderer.cpp` and `video.cpp` compile in the asset-free boundary,
  also with the Android branches (`-D__ANDROID__`); Java/JNI contract test.
- CI "Steprant Android integration" (android, host, vulkan jobs) on the branch.

Not performed: ARM64 APK build (private input), device run, measured FPS,
GPU time, temperature or battery.

## Device protocol (Xiaomi 14)

Same save and scene, preferably a heavy one (the fire boss or a crowded
battle), 30 FPS, warm shader cache, Tester *Advanced*, 5 minutes each:

| Run | Render | Shadow | Compact targets | ADPF |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A (baseline) | 1080 | 2x | off | off |
| B | 1080 | 2x | **on** | off |
| C | 1080 | **1x** | on | off |
| D | **900** | 1x | on | off |
| E | best of B–D | | on | **on** |

Compare per run: `gpu passes:` pass_ms/outside_ms/load+store MB, slow frames
and 1% low from the Tester, `performance hints:` work, battery temperature.
Restart after changing compact targets. Display refresh matching is on in
all runs; turn it off once to compare panel power if wanted.

## Device sessions of 2026-11-06 evening (1.6 test build `a81a116a`)

Three Tester recordings (22:16, 22:25, 22:35; the last two are one run),
Turnip (Mesa 26.0.0-devel) on the Xiaomi 14, 30 FPS, FXAA, SGSR1, shadows 2x.

- Steady scenes hold 30.0 FPS (p95 34 ms). GPU busy 21–25 ms per frame
  (65–75% at 30 FPS). Slow intervals sit in scene changes with 4,000+ draw
  frames; inline pipeline compiles are near zero and the thermal status
  stays 0 (battery up to 44.8 °C).
- Main scene per frame: about 110 render passes and 1,800–1,900 draws;
  ~25 colour+depth passes and ~25 depth-only passes on the same target, in
  alternation; 73–80 barriers, 10–13 copies. Colour formats by draws:
  7e3 ≈ 450 + 7e3_as_16 ≈ 285 against 8888 ≈ 95, so compact targets change
  little here.
- Resolution sensitivity is low. A depth-only draw costs ≈ 3.7 µs at
  2003×920 and at 2403×1104, a scene draw ≈ 8.0 µs and ≈ 8.9 µs: GPU time
  follows draws (vertex and per-draw shader work), not pixels.
- Presentation: SGSR1 runs as a compute dispatch at 1080 → 2670×1200 and as
  a graphics pass at 900p, about 2–2.5 ms either way; FXAA at 2403×1080
  about 1.3 ms.
- Audio: no queue starvation during play in either XMA lock mode, no clock
  resets, the audio thread never waits for the XMA decoder.

### Consequences in the build

1. **Uniform-buffer shader constants** (Tester *Shader constants in UBO*,
   restart). Pointer-form SPIR-V reads every `XeConst(n)`, the sampler
   indices and the vertex-fetch offsets with `vk::RawBufferLoad` from device
   addresses — on Adreno, a global memory load each, which fits the
   per-draw, resolution-independent cost above. The UBO form (the Switch
   pack's) reads the same `cbuffer`s from set 5; Turnip can upload
   statically indexed ranges into the constant registers and serves the
   rest from the constant cache. No published pack has this form: the first
   start runs the full shader preparation on the phone (translation + DXC,
   progress screen, several minutes) and later starts load the local
   startup bundle. Turnip keeps its dynamic-offset descriptor set on Adreno
   7xx+ (`gpu::adreno::Generation`); otherwise the renderer keeps the
   pointer form.
2. **One pass for depth-only draws** (live): keeps the scene colour target
   bound for depth-only draws, removing ~45 pass changes per frame. An
   older note measured Turnip sysmem ~9% slower; to be measured again with
   the pass profile (`depth_only_keeps_color=` in the format line).
3. **Turnip render mode** (restart): Automatic / Sysmem / GMEM.
4. The title screen's full-screen mesh layer is no longer drawn
   (`LO_SCREEN_PATTERN=1` restores it).

### Next device protocol

Same save and spot, 30 FPS, Tester *Intensive*, 3 minutes standing still +
2 minutes moving, for each of:

| Run | Shader constants | Depth-only pass | Turnip mode |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | pointer | off | Automatic |
| B | pointer | **on** | Automatic |
| C | **UBO** (after its first preparation) | off | Automatic |
| D | UBO | best of A/B | Automatic |
| E | best | best | **Sysmem**, then **GMEM** |

Compare `gpu passes:` pass_ms + outside_ms and per-target ms, the Tester
GPU busy and 1% low.

## A/B results of 2026-11-07 and what the build keeps

Six recordings (08:43–10:13), Xiaomi 14, Turnip, 1080 internal, 30 FPS
unless noted. Medians over gameplay windows (> 1,200 draws per frame):

| Run | Constants | Depth-only pass | Turnip | Passes | Pass ms | GPU ms/frame |
|---|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 08:43 | pointer | separate | auto | 104 | 19.4 | 24.2 |
| 09:12 | UBO | separate | auto | 102 | 19.3 | 24.2 (13% more draws) |
| 09:33 | UBO | kept | GMEM | 67 | 26.6 | 31.4 |
| 10:03 | UBO | kept | sysmem | 64 | 17.9 | 23.1 |
| 10:13 | UBO | kept | auto | 74 | 17.8 | 22.1 |

Per scene draw: pointer 8.6 µs, UBO 7.9 µs. In the 10:13 run 720p
(1602×736) costs ~12.7 ms against ~22 ms at 1080p in comparable scenes.

Kept: depth-only draws in the scene pass (Android default), compact 8-bit
targets (always on Android), display refresh matching, 64 ms audio buffer.
Removed: UBO constants (~7% for a long first-start compile and a ~900 MB
bundle), Turnip render mode (GMEM much slower), ADPF hints (no effect on a
GPU-bound frame), per-voice XMA locks (audio clean without them).

The remaining large lever is rendering fewer pixels: SGSR1 already
reconstructs 720p/900p to the 2670×1200 panel, but it is spatial only. A
temporal upscaler (Qualcomm SGSR2, BSD-3) fed with the renderer's jitter,
depth and motion vectors would let 720p look close to native.

## SGSR2 (experimental), 2026-11-07

Anti-aliasing → **SGSR2** with an *SGSR2 quality* row (Quality 1.5×,
Balanced 1.7×, Performance 2.0×, Native AA). It runs on the renderer's
temporal SR route, like FSR: jittered scene colour, reversed R32 depth,
backward render-pixel motion and motion invalidity are copied at the scene
boundary, and Qualcomm's 2-pass compute SGSR2 (BSD-3, adapted to HLSL in
`gpu/shader/sgsr2_source.h`) writes an RGBA16F output that the RGB composite
returns to the game's target before the UI.

Adaptations to the reference: reversed Z; the renderer's motion vectors
instead of a velocity texture or a clip-to-previous-clip matrix; motion
invalidity forces the depth clip; a reset frame never reads the previous
history (it can be uninitialised or a discarded frame's, and NaN × 0 is
NaN); SDR input skips the reference's `rgb / (max + 1)` tone map (HDR keeps
it, with an exact inverse); the output is clipped to [0, 1] for SDR.

Motion is camera-only by default (`LO_SGSR2_OBJECT_MV=1` adds the object
replay) because the replay's vertex work would cost more than SGSR2 saves;
the colour clamp handles moving characters. `LO_SGSR2_JITTER_SIGN=-1` flips
the jitter handed to SGSR2 to check the convention on a device.

`tools/tests/sgsr2` runs the production controller and shaders on lavapipe
(CI: *SGSR2 Vulkan readbacks*), 64×36 → 128×72:

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| flat colour after reset / accumulation | worst error 0.0015 |
| jittered static scene, RMSE R/G/B vs ideal 128×72 | 0.006 / 0.067 / 0.026 (bilinear 0.000 / 0.169 / 0.057) |
| same with the jitter sign flipped | 0.023 / 0.291 / 0.032 |
| pan with backward vectors vs reversed vectors | 0.009 / 0.224 / 0.035 vs 0.124 / 0.263 / 0.161 |
| HDR flat colour (2.0, 0.5, 0.25) | 0.5% |
| slots, resize, discard and shutdown lifecycle | pass |

The green channel is a sinusoid above the render Nyquist limit: SGSR2
recovers it on a still camera and, as expected, not during a pan. Not yet
measured on the Adreno 750.

### First device session (2026-11-07) and changes

Xiaomi 14, 2670×1200 output, GPU busy at 30 FPS: native 81%, Quality
(1780×800) 66–74%, Balanced (1571×706) 60–66%, Performance (1335×600) 63%.
Findings and changes:

- **Flat, soft textures**: scene textures were sampled at the mip of the
  render resolution. Scene-texture samplers now take `log2(render/output)`
  LOD bias in quarter steps (−0.5 at 1.5×, −1.0 at 2×) while a temporal SR
  consumer is planned (`LO_SR_MIP_BIAS=0` off, `=<lod>` override). Only
  samplers `sampling::Eligible` already selects for anisotropy (depth-tested
  scene geometry); UI and render-target fetches are untouched.
- **Soft output**: a contrast-adaptive sharpen (one cross lobe limited by
  the neighbourhood range, RCAS-style, written for this port) runs after the
  accumulation, strength 0.5 (`LO_SGSR2_SHARPNESS=0..1`).
- **One-frame pops**: 61 single-frame fallbacks (`UnknownColorEncoding`)
  came from a lost SDR write-ordinal proof after a tile transfer into the
  scene; each reset the history and showed one SGSR1 frame. SGSR2 now
  accepts the RGBA8 scene whenever view, frame, extent and swizzle match.
- **Menus**: frames without an eligible 3D scene (menus, transitions;
  `NoEligibleScene`) are not upscaled by SGSR2: they render at the SGSR2
  input size and SGSR1 enlarges them. Keeping SGSR1 on is therefore useful.
  Rendering those frames at the output size needs a plan switch and is not
  done yet.
- **576p**: new render resolution row. With SGSR2 it renders 576 lines
  (1282×576 on this panel, about 2.1×) whatever the quality row says; other
  rows keep the SGSR2 quality ratio.

### Second round (2026-11-07): menus, NPC shadows, aliasing

- **Menus at the output size**: after 20 frames without a 3D scene for SGSR2
  (`NoEligibleScene`: menus, pause, transitions) the CPU plan asks for
  SGSR2's native-AA size, the output size, so the 2D screens are no longer
  enlarged from the SGSR2 input. The first frame SGSR2 submits again (a 3D
  scene is back) returns to the chosen quality; a 90-frame cooldown keeps a
  scene that flickers between eligible and not from reallocating every few
  frames. `gpu/sgsr2_idle_policy.h`, covered by the frame plan test;
  `LO_SGSR2_NATIVE_MENUS=0` turns it off.
- **NPC shadows**: the session ran Dynamic shadows = Low, which keeps the
  shadows of only eight casters, the largest on screen; in Uhra's squares a
  dozen NPCs traded those places and the smaller ones' shadows vanished and
  came back. Low keeps sixteen casters on Android. On keeps them all.
- **Aliasing**: SGSR2 now also rejects history where the previous frame's
  depth shows a nearer surface everywhere around the reprojected position
  (a disocclusion test the 2-pass reference lacks; it helps moving
  characters, which have no motion vectors of their own). On the fixture's
  1.3-pixel railings the reference's depth-edge clip resolved them best, so
  it stays (`LO_SGSR2_EDGE_CLIP` can weight it). Sharpening drops to 0.3,
  since sharpened edges show stair steps more. Every 300 frames the log
  prints `SGSR2 jitter:` with the jittered, unjittered and unknown-camera
  scene draws: unjittered draws are never anti-aliased by SGSR2.

### Third round (2026-11-07): blocks in shadows, transition ghosting

Device session with Dynamic shadows On showed a blocky, brick-like pattern
over shadowed walls and floors at the SGSR2 input sizes (not at the output
size). The `SGSR2 jitter:` lines show every known scene draw jittered but
one or two draws a frame in the scene viewport with no known camera
constant, so unjittered: the class of bug fixed for cutscene shadow volumes
in PR #197 (a depth-testing pass half a pixel off the jittered depth flips
its stencil or shadow test per triangle or texel). Under SR those
depth-testing unknown draws now take the frame jitter as a viewport
translation, which moves clip space exactly as the projection offset does
(`LO_SR_VIEWPORT_JITTER=0` off); each such pair is logged once, and the
periodic line counts them (`viewport_jittered=`). Resolved render targets
(shadow maps, scene copies) are also excluded from anisotropic filtering and
the SR mip bias.

Transitions: the menu policy returned to the quality size on the first 3D
frame, often in the middle of a fade-in. It now enters after 30 scene-less
frames and returns after 20 consecutive upscaled frames.

## Early depth rejection restored (2026-11-07)

The profiles say the main scene pass is pixel-bound, not draw-bound: from
1780×800 to 1282×576 (0.52× the pixels) its time per draw falls 1.7×
(about 3.2 ms per megapixel, 1.8 µs per draw). 852 of its ~1,530 draws a
frame are depth-only: the game lays depth down first, so the colour pass
should shade only visible pixels. It did not. Every translated pixel shader
carries the Xenos alpha test as a dynamic branch ending in `discard`, also
when the game has the test off; a shader that can discard makes Turnip (and
tile GPUs in general) give up early Z for the draw and stop writing LRZ, so
every covered fragment was shaded before its depth test.

The alpha test is now pipeline state on native Vulkan
(`pipeline_cache::kFlagAlphaTest` in the key). Plume gives each fragment
module whose only `OpKill` is that test (exactly one `OpKill`, no
terminate/demote) a second module with the instruction turned into
`OpUnreachable` (one word each, patched in place), and pipelines whose draws
have the alpha test off use it (`RenderGraphicsPipelineDesc::
pixelShaderWithoutKill`), on the monolithic and the fast-link path alike.
The translated HLSL and the shader packs are unchanged (an earlier
specialization-constant version invalidated the 235 MB pack and was
replaced). Shaders with Xenos kill instructions have two `OpKill`s and keep
their module. Old pipeline recipes (flags 0) prewarm the kill-free variant.
`LO_ALPHATEST_SPEC=0` keeps the discard everywhere. `tools/tests/
kill_free_module_test.cpp` checks module selection and identical output on
lavapipe.

### Depth-only draws without their no-op pixel shader

852 draws a frame write no colour (depth pre-pass, shadow maps, stencil
volumes, occlusion boxes). Their pipelines kept the game's pixel shader,
which then ran for every fragment that passed the depth test with no effect
at all (no colour write, and with the alpha test off its only possible
effect, the discard, cannot happen). On native Vulkan such pipelines now
have no fragment shader when the shader neither exports depth nor has a
second kill (`PixelShaderIsNoOp`), so the hardware takes its depth-only
path. Occlusion-query draws with such a shader are counted by the fragment
counter instead of a host query, like draws without one.
`LO_KEEP_DEPTH_ONLY_PS=1` keeps the shaders.
